##Code Kata Exercises
"A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published 21 different katas." [1]
